C: The interval of a [minor third] spans [three semitones].

C: An [octave] spans [twelve semitones].

## Triads and Chords

C: A [major triad] consists of [root, major third, and perfect fifth].

C: A [minor triad] consists of [root, minor third, and perfect fifth].

C: A [diminished triad] consists of [root, minor third, and diminished fifth].

## Harmonic Functions

C: The [tonic] chord is built on the [first scale degree].

C: The [dominant] chord is built on the [fifth scale degree].

C: The [subdominant] chord is built on the [fourth scale degree].

Q: What is a harmonic progression that ends a phrase called?
A: Cadence

C: A [perfect authentic cadence] moves from [V to I].

C: A [plagal cadence] moves from [IV to I].

## Note Values

C: A [whole note] receives [four beats] in 4/4 time.

C: A [half note] receives [two beats] in 4/4 time.

C: A [quarter note] receives [one beat] in 4/4 time.

C: An [eighth note] receives [half a beat] in 4/4 time.

Q: How much does a dot increase a note's duration?
A: Half its original value

## Scales

Q: Which minor scale raises the seventh scale degree?
A: Harmonic minor

Q: Which minor scale raises the sixth and seventh degrees ascending?
A: Melodic minor

C: A [pentatonic scale] contains [five notes per octave].

Q: What scale degrees does the major pentatonic scale use?
A: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

Q: What note does the blues scale add to the minor pentatonic?
A: Flattened fifth
