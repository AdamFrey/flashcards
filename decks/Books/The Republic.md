Q: What does Sophocles answer to "how does love suit with old age?"
A: "[I'm happy to have] escaped from a mad and furious master"

C: "there is no one [in any rule] who, [in so far as he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest], but [always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his art]; to that he looks, and [that alone he considers in everything which he says and does]."
